## ðŸ“˜ Section 1: Self Evaluation and Feedback

=== "Essential Skills"

    | **Skill Area**            | **Reflection** |
    |---------------------------|----------------|
    | **Communication**         | Strong in client-facing roles with Public Sector/Government clients. Led training sessions for new employees and created onboarding documentation. Experience presenting technical solutions to stakeholders across different sectors. I feel confident in verbal communication, particularly during stand-ups, sprint reviews, and technical discussions. I regularly explain complex DevOps topics to non-technical audiences. One area for improvement is making written documentation (e.g., Jira tickets, Confluence pages) clearer and more accessible. |
    | **Problem Solving**       | Excellent track record - automated server process monitoring, resolved P1 service outages for HSCNI databases, and migrated legacy applications to Azure. Strong analytical approach to infrastructure challenges. Iâ€™m often relied on to diagnose and resolve platform issues, particularly around Kubernetes, and Keycloak. I work methodically, but want to better document findings for future reference and shared learning. |
    | **Creativity**            | Demonstrated through designing custom automation solutions (Ansible process kicker), creating Kubernetes mini-environments, and developing innovative deployment strategies for diverse client needs. I regularly develop automation tools and scripts to streamline recurring tasks. I enjoy proposing new ideas and actively contribute to team retros and planning improvements. |
    | **Mindset**               | Adaptable and growth-oriented - recently completed KCNA certification, transitioned from military to tech, and successfully works across multiple sectors (defence, government, private). Continuous learning approach. I take a growth-oriented approach and actively seek feedback. I'm resilient in high-pressure scenarios, though I can occasionally feel frustration when external blockers persist. I reflect often and continuously try to improve. |
    | **Teamwork & Leadership** | Led training sessions, mentored team members in the Army, guided product onboarding teams, and collaborated across multidisciplinary teams. Recognized with Commander's Certificate of Excellence for team performance. As a previous Scrum Master, I led ceremonies, supported the team in removing blockers, and mentoring junior colleagues. Feedback suggested Iâ€™m approachable and supportive. I aim to improve delegation and grow in influencing upwards. |

=== "Technical Competencies (DevOps)"

    | **Competency Area** | **Reflection** |
    |---------------------|----------------|
    | **Knowledge**       | Strong in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), CI/CD practices, infrastructure as code, containerization with Docker/Kubernetes. Solid foundation in multiple programming languages and database technologies. Recent KCNA certification demonstrates current knowledge. |
    | **Tools**           | Proficient with Jenkins, GitLab CI, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, AWS services (CloudWatch, EKS), Git, SonarQube, Grafana. Experience spans development, deployment, and monitoring tools across the DevOps lifecycle. |
    | **Methods**         | Experienced in end-to-end DevOps implementation, CI/CD pipeline design, infrastructure automation, and collaborative development practices. Strong in documentation creation and knowledge transfer methodologies. |
