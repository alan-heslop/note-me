Led training sessions for new employees and created onboarding documentation. Experience presenting technical solutions to stakeholders across different sectors. I feel confident in verbal communication, particularly during stand-ups, sprint reviews, and technical discussions. I regularly explain complex DevOps topics to non-technical audiences. One area for improvement is making written documentation (e.g., Jira tickets, Confluence pages) clearer and more accessible. Problem Solving Excellent track record - automated server process monitoring, resolved P1 service outages for HSCNI databases, and migrated legacy applications to Azure. Strong analytical approach to infrastructure challenges. I\u2019m often relied on to diagnose and resolve platform issues, particularly around Kubernetes, and Keycloak. I work methodically, but want to better document findings for future reference and shared learning. Creativity Demonstrated through designing custom automation solutions (Ansible process kicker), creating Kubernetes mini-environments, and developing innovative deployment strategies for diverse client needs. I regularly develop automation tools and scripts to streamline recurring tasks. I enjoy proposing new ideas and actively contribute to team retros and planning improvements. Mindset Adaptable and growth-oriented - recently completed KCNA certification, transitioned from military to tech, and successfully works across multiple sectors (defence, government, private). Continuous learning approach. I take a growth-oriented approach and actively seek feedback. I'm resilient in high-pressure scenarios, though I can occasionally feel frustration when external blockers persist. I reflect often and continuously try to improve. Teamwork &amp; Leadership Led training sessions, mentored team members in the Army, guided product onboarding teams, and collaborated across multidisciplinary teams. Recognized with Commander's Certificate of Excellence for team performance. As a previous Scrum Master, I led ceremonies, supported the team in removing blockers, and mentoring junior colleagues. Feedback suggested I\u2019m approachable and supportive. I aim to improve delegation and grow in influencing upwards. Competency Area Reflection Knowledge Strong in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), CI/CD practices, infrastructure as code, containerization with Docker/Kubernetes. Solid foundation in multiple programming languages and database technologies. Recent KCNA certification demonstrates current knowledge. Tools Proficient with Jenkins, GitLab CI, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, AWS services (CloudWatch, EKS), Git, SonarQube, Grafana. Experience spans development, deployment, and monitoring tools across the DevOps lifecycle. Methods Experienced in end-to-end DevOps implementation, CI/CD pipeline design, infrastructure automation, and collaborative development practices. Strong in documentation creation and knowledge transfer methodologies. \ud83d\udcac Feedback Summary <p>Consistently receive positive feedback on technical problem-solving abilities and client relationship management. Strong feedback on training delivery and mentoring capabilities. Areas for growth include expanding cloud certifications and deeper experience with monitoring tools like Grafana in production environments.</p> \ud83d\udcac Current Reflection <p>I believe I am working as</p>"},{"location":"pdp/pdp/#section-2-strengths-and-areas-for-development","title":"\ud83e\udded Section 2: Strengths and Areas for Development","text":"Technical Competencies Category Strengths Development Areas Priority Notes Knowledge CI/CD principles (E) Cloud networking/security (C) High Strengthen VPC, Security Groups, NACLs Server OS basics (E) Container orchestration (D) Medium Expand Kubernetes knowledge Cloud architecture (E) Tools Scripting (Python/Shell) (E) Log aggregation (D) Medium Improve ELK/Splunk/Prometheus queries CI/CD pipelines (E) Infrastructure as Code (D) Low Deepen Terraform/CloudFormation skills Basic Docker usage (E) Monitoring dashboards (C) Medium Enhance CloudWatch/Grafana skills Methods Troubleshooting (E) Documentation (D) Low Polish runbooks/wiki clarity Learning new tools (E) Code quality (D) Low Improve code organization/comments Essential Skills Strengths Development Areas Priority Notes Communication (All E) Problem Solving High Focus on complex problem research (B) and best practice application (C) Mindset (All E) Teamwork &amp; Leadership - Self-Awareness Medium Improve reflection on biases/assumptions (B) Teamwork &amp; Leadership (Mostly E/D) Teamwork &amp; Leadership - Business Acumen Low Better understand Opencast's market position (B)"},{"location":"pdp/pdp/#section-3-goals-and-actions","title":"\ud83c\udfaf Section 3: Goals and Actions","text":""},{"location":"pdp/pdp/#goal-1-become-more-proficient-with-helm-and-terraform","title":"Goal 1: Become more proficient with Helm and Terraform","text":"<ul> <li>[ ] A) Complete Helm and Terraform deep-dive course by October 2025  </li> <li>[ ] B) Build and deploy a non-critical service using Helm charts  </li> <li>[ ] C) Refactor existing Terraform repo for reusability</li> </ul> <p>Success = Confidently maintain and improve existing infra using Helm and Terraform Support needed = Mentorship + code review from Senior Engineer</p>"},{"location":"pdp/pdp/#goal-2-improve-time-management-and-delegation","title":"Goal 2: Improve time management and delegation","text":"<ul> <li>[ ] A) Use daily calendar planning and Kanban for personal task tracking  </li> <li>[ ] B) Delegate 2 low-priority items per sprint  </li> <li>[ ] C) Block 2 hours per week for deep work</li> </ul> <p>Success = Reduced sprint spillover, more time for strategy work Support = Line manager check-ins + feedback loop</p>"},{"location":"pdp/pdp/#section-4-progress-reflection","title":"\ud83d\udcc8 Section 4: Progress Reflection","text":"Action Log Action Taken Impact on Goals Support / Next Steps Completed Helm tutorial &amp; deployed test app Improved confidence with releases Schedule shadowing w/ Infra Delegated report creation to junior staff Freed time for grooming sessions Continue 1:1s Adopted calendar blocking for deep work Reduced interruptions Share template with others"}]}
